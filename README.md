# Short Term solar energy prediction
This project aims to improve the accuracy of short-term solar energy production prediction, which can help in
the large-scale adoption of renewable energy and reduce uncertainty.

The approach involves using ensemble learning models in machine learning to factor in weak data from various power production stations and weather forecast
data. Various ensemble learning methods such as Randomforest, and boosting algorithms will be used to predict the
solar energy production for the short term.

The project will use data sources from Kaggle and will use the training data from 1994-2007 and public testing data from 2008-2009.
